# CP-setup
Competitive Programming setup of Naman Goyal   
## Objectives :   
1.) you should be able to create folders for one contest    
2.) Have a proper theme (light theme always ) , able to setup the compiler and stuff !!   
3.) Code flawlessly :D   
## Step to follow  :  
### 1.) Applying the theme   : 
Make sure you have drivers , google chrome , extensions (email id )  , mobile and ipad setup !! 
save your rough work in onenotoe and send it to the contest folder  ,useful in analyzing contest !! 
Download Sublime text (latest version preferred )  
Install cpp (compiler ) in your pc  
select adaptive theme in sublime text  
Select BREAKERS as your color scheme !! (light theme )  
Customize the BREAKERS color scheme from the cutomizations folder  (paste it into the right pane ! )  
ctrl  + shift  + p to install package control (use it to install the required packages  , you can either use the template option here or use the script )   
moreover windows theme is just blue accent color of your choice and backgruond is the color black !!   

### 2.) Generating the files and folders for a test   
copy the make_prob.bat to your cp folder 
just run .\make_prob.bat to generate the folder by the contest name and subfolders based on number of problems with its input and output file !! 
 
### 3.) Running the code from input.in and directing the output to output.in  
Build system to directly compile and run c++ programs in sublime on linux. Moreover it uses c++14 directly opposed to the fact that terminal doesnt.  

Instructions :  

Go to Tools > Build Systems > New Build System  
Copy the code from C++14.sublime-build and paste it ther and save it by any name.    
Go to Tools > Build Systems ans select your new build system     
Create 2 files named inputf.in and outputf.in in same directory in which u have ur code.        
Write input in inputf.in, save and run the code in sublime and you will get output in outputf.in .      
Tips :  

You can use CTRL + shift + B to directly compile run.  
You can use 3 pane setup to view code, input dile and output file at once (ALT + SHIFT + 3).
